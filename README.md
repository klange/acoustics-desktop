# Acoustics Desktop #

This is a collection of scripts and tools to make Acoustics interface well with desktop PCs. There's not all that much here, but if I'm bored I might write a new script or tool or widgit or something every so often.

## amp-notification ##

Checks every five seconds for the currently playing song on an Acoustics instance and, if the song changes, displays a notification popup with Notify OSD or similar systems.
